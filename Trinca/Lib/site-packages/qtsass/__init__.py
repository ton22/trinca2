"""
The SASS language brings countless amazing features to CSS.

Besides being used in web development, CSS is also the way to stylize Qt-based
desktop applications. However, Qt's CSS has a few variations that prevent the
direct use of SASS compiler.

The purpose of qtsass is to fill the gap between SASS and Qt-CSS by handling
those variations.
